    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat thatâ€™s just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

            Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
